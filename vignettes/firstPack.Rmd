The [firstPack package](https://github.com/ehyaei/simBrM) was written to illustrate R package construction.

It has just two functions. `simBrM()` to simulate Brownian motion.

```{r load_and_sim}
library(firstPack)
x <- simBrM(1000)
```

Plus `plotBrM()` to plot the result.

```{r plot}
plotBrM(x)
```
